I learnt about threads and binding in this workshop. I used the fstream library. 
ifstream for reading and ofstream for writing in file.
We use binary file for efficency. Storing text uses much more amount of memory than binary.
Its also much faster to read binary file. You can make different fuctors that can accept many types of arguments using the std::bind.
As example for that the provided function converter() has different aruguments types (char*, char, int, Cryptors&).
Mutithreading is very important because it enables cpu to do multiple things at a time which makes this faster.
Its very efficent also because cpu is not getting stressed at one part. Its work is divided so as the stress.
