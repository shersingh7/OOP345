This is my favorite workshop so far. I enjoyed a lot doing this workshop. 
I learnt alot about using the algorith library. I used vector for the better handling of arrays.

The list of STL function that I used in this workshop are as follows:

sort(): for sorting the collection by the title, length and the album;
for_each(): for the display function used for showing the collection songs;
any_of: in the inCollection function for searching for the artist name in the collection;
accumulate: in the display function for calculating the total length of the song;
copy_if(): in the getSongsForArtist function for checking if the artist exits in the list.

Algorithms are much more efficient that doing the same thing the normal way. They are quick as the whole logic is already their in the library ready to use.
As the logic is already there we just use it and will make our code much shorter and cleaner. 
It will also reduce the errors as their will be much less code.

Try and catch method can be used in the sort colection function.
If the input is invalid, throw exception and catch it client side.
