I learnt about vectors in this workshop. I also got to practice alot of lambda functions. I got good practice in 
handling the string input from the <string> library. The biggest problem was also in the input handling of the strings
I had to get the tag name and compare if it was for car or racecar. Then I had to remove the spaces from the string
to get the correct input.

Deallocation of dynamically allocated memory in vector is important beacause as we use the 
push_back function of the vector, it will make a dynamic array and it doesnt not destroy it on its own.
That is why we need to manually call the destructor for the vector.

The loadData() uses the try and catch() method for detecting the unknown type of vehicle.
The other way for doing the same thing is by using the if statement for filtering.

We use sdds::Vehicle* instead of sdds::Vehicle is due to the fact that we add the address of the object to the dynamic
array in the vector. As we iterate, we use *i for displaying the value.
