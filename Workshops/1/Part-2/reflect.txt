This workshop was the first one after the 1 month winter break so I was very lazy doing it.
I learnt many things in this workshop. I learnt teh use of linkage. 
I also got a deep dive in the copy constructor concepts. The main issue I came across was with
the event time. I didn't know how to make it start work. So I read the readme file carefully and
used searched in the course notes for help. After reading the course notes I came to know that
I have to used the g_sysClock global variable as it stored the start time. As I said,
I used the course notes website for the revision of the linkage topics. I also used the extern keyword
before the g_sysclock so that i can used the variable in multiple files such as Event.cpp and Event.cpp in my case.
I was confused about the output as in line 19 of my output had a word sudoku but the sample output file
had S capital in Sudoko. The tuesday file also had the small s sudoko. Rest, the output was perfect.
Before coding for the copy constructor, I had to revise the concepts as they were some what blurry in
my mind. The difference between the internal and external linkage as the name suggest is that internal
is only for the current module whereas external is used so that the variables can be used globally and
in different modules. But afterall, the project was complete and learnt that not to leave any project even if you think is easy
for the last day.
